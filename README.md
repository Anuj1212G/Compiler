# 🔍 Parser Implementations in C

This repository contains C programs to implement various parsing techniques used in Compiler Design:

- ✅ LL(1) Parser
- ✅ FIRST and FOLLOW set computation
- ✅ Operator Precedence Parser
- ✅ LEADING and TRAILING set computation

## 📁 Files Included

| File                         | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| `ll1_parser.c`               | Implements an LL(1) parser using predictive parsing table |
| `first_follow.c`            | Calculates the FIRST and FOLLOW sets of a given grammar |
| `operator_precedence.c`     | Parses expressions using operator precedence relations |
| `leading_trailing.c`        | Computes the LEADING and TRAILING sets for operator precedence grammars |

---

## ⚙️ How to Compile and Run

### Step 1: Compile

Use `gcc` to compile any of the source files. Example:

```bash
gcc ll1_parser.c -o ll1_parser
```

### Step 2: Run

Execute the compiled file:

```bash
./ll1_parser
```

Repeat the steps for each individual file.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

### 1. LL(1) Parser

- Uses a predictive parsing table
- Requires FIRST and FOLLOW sets
- Input is parsed using a stack and table lookup

### 2. FIRST and FOLLOW Sets

- FIRST: set of terminals that begin strings derivable from a non-terminal
- FOLLOW: set of terminals that can appear immediately to the right of a non-terminal in some sentential form

### 3. Operator Precedence Parsing

- Handles expressions like `i+i*i`
- Uses precedence relations (`<`, `>`, `=`) to decide when to shift or reduce
- Employs a precedence table for terminals

### 4. LEADING and TRAILING Sets

- Used in construction of operator precedence grammar
- LEADING: terminals that appear at the start of strings derived from a non-terminal
- TRAILING: terminals that appear at the end

---

## 📌 Notes

- Expressions use `i` as a placeholder for identifiers
- Terminals such as `+`, `*`, `(`, `)` are used in operator precedence
- Ensure grammars are suitable (non-left-recursive for LL(1), operator precedence for others)

---

## 🧪 Example Inputs

- LL(1): Grammar rules and a string to test
- FIRST/FOLLOW: Grammar in production form
- Operator Precedence: Expression like `i+i*i`
- LEADING/TRAILING: Grammar for precedence relation setup
